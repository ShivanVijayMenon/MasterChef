To make the mixture, add a cup of marmalade and some lemon juice to a pan of boiling water before stirring well. Let it cool before leaving it to chill.

Start to freeze the mixture using a sorbetire. Pack ice all around the outside and sprinkle with salt in between as you go to help reduce the temperature of the ice. Once the mixture is cool enough, pour it into the sorbetire. Keep it moving gently with a spoon, before placing the lid on and rotating the sorbetire a few turns every so often to help evenly lower the temperature of the mixture. As the mixture starts to freeze into a water ice, be sure to give it a good stir.

Once the mixture has frozen, choose a suitable mold and spoon it in until the mold is full. Then, leave in an ice box to freeze. Once frozen, gently turn out on to a plate and decorate as desired.
